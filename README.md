# Network-Monitoring

For this project, I completed a series of immersive lab exercises focused on network monitoring using Splunk, a popular data analysis and visualization tool. The tasks involved understanding Splunk fundamentals, such as data source variety and the significance of source types, as well as advanced topics like search querying, visualization creation, and dashboard customization.

**Search Fundamentals:** The initial section delved into the basics of Splunk, emphasizing its ability to collect data from various sources within an organization. It covered topics such as understanding data sources, the importance of source types in data handling, and basic search structures. The learner gained insights into efficient data administration, filtering, and troubleshooting potential issues.

**Advanced Searching:** This section expanded on the basic search concepts and introduced more advanced techniques using Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL). Topics included utilizing SPL commands for data manipulation, understanding Boolean expressions, wildcard usage, and conducting focused searches for specific scenarios such as identifying common and uncommon field values and tracking probable attack scenarios.

**Visualization and Dashboard Creation:** Here, the focus shifted to visualizing data and creating dashboards in Splunk. Learners gained hands-on experience in structuring and visualizing summary data, understanding different visualization types (e.g., pie charts, bar charts), and customizing dashboards to specific monitoring and presentation needs.

Overall, the project solidified my understanding of Splunk's capabilities, from basic data collection to advanced searching and visualization techniques. It showed how to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, emphasizing the practical relevance of Splunk in network and security operations.
